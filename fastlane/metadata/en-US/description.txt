Sans Fonts is a web content blocker for iOS 9 that blocks web fonts.

What are web fonts? Web pages can either use fonts that come with the operating system, or they can refer to font files on the internet, so-called web fonts.

Why would you want to block web fonts? Your iPhone/iPad is a mobile device, and web fonts add extra downloads to web pages you load. This means:

• A delay until text on web pages is finally being shown, especially when the signal is weak.
• Wasted bandwidth.
• Privacy implications: many web fonts are loaded from third-party servers, which can potentially track you.
• Security: if your browser has to do less work, you’ll generally be (slightly) more secure as a result.

We all appreciate beautiful typography…except when we need to look up a phone number while on a 2G (EDGE/GPRS) network, and we can’t read the web page until the font has loaded.
